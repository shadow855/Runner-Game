# Runner-Game
My first 3D Game.
In this game a 3D box will run and collect boxes of the same type.
If you will collide with any other object, then... Boom... Game Over.
Click anywhere on the screen to pause/restart the game.
In this game I've used some fog codes to create a little suspense of future steps.
The game is in building phase and is out for trial only.
Steps to download the game-
1- Click on link and click on view code under main branch.
